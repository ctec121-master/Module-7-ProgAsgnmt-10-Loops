# Module 7 - Programming Assignment - Problem 4

**Sepecification**

Write a program that:
- Asks the user for an interest rate
- Reads in balances from a file ("balances.txt")
- Calculates updated balances based on the interest rate
- Writes the new balances out to the file, overwriting the previous balances. Make sure you retain the proper formatting for currency numbers, i.e. two decimal places.
- DO NOT stage, commit, or push the balances.txt file. This is accomplished by:
    - click on the source code control icon on the left navbar
    - select balance.txt
    - right-click and select Discard changes
    - confirm your selection - the file should be removed from the list of modified files. At this point you can commit your changes.

**Additional Requirements**
- Use a list structure to store the balances
- Use a function that takes the list and the interest rate as parameters and updates the list elements
