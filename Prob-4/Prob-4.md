# Module 7 - Programming Assignment - Problem 4

**Sepecification**

Write a program that:
- Asks the user for an interest rate
- Reads in balances from a file ("balances.txt")
- Calculates updated balances based on the interest rate
- Writes the new balances out to a new file "balances.out". Make sure you retain the proper formatting for currency numbers, i.e. two decimal places.

**Additional Requirements**
- Use a list structure to store the balances
- Use a function that takes the list and the interest rate as parameters and updates the list elements
